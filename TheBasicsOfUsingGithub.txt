My notes on the basics of using Github since I tend to forget
(Mainly based on watching this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE&list=PLhqtdvT7_bdkx8GqHQfSnkWmUyKS6_Se4&index=2)

1) Make the repository, make sure to include README file, when you go to the repository's page, 
   go to the code tab, then copy the link to the repository.

2) In CMD, move to the directory of your choosing, then type git clone (Paste the url here, without the parentheses) 
   This pulls the repository into your designated directory, in a folder with the same name as the repo.

3) From here, do what you want, add code and other files. 
   Tip: for future steps, it helps for file names to not have spaces in them.
   Tip 2: Remember to save your file when you're done working.

4) In terminal, when you're done, do git status. This shows what's different compared to what's on Github.

5) If a file isn't being tracked or is ready to commit, to add it do git add (name of file) 
   Tip: to add all files do git add -A

6) Once everything is added and ready, do git commit -m "Message about the changes, don't be generic"
   Note: You can just do git commit, but that's mainly for multi-line commits. When you do that if you get stuck,
   press ESC, then do :, then do wq, then hit enter. That should take you back to the regular CMD.

7) Once you've commited all your changes, to push them out to Github do git push
   In contrast, if you want to pull all changes that have been made to the repo, do git pull
